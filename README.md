1. 4 exercises with bugs in the code.
2. Run ruby filename.rb to find the error in the code.
3. Fix the bug in the code.
4. Run ruby filename.rb to demonstrate that the bug has been fixed.

3 systematic steps I use when debugging code:

Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from).

Get visibility (use p to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line).

Once you know the one thing that is wrong, out of place, misspelled, or not giving you what you expect, try to fix it.
